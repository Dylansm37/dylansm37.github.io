### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 1 as well as part 2 were some of my favorites because of
    the work involving classes. Ive studied computer science before and 
    was never clear on them so it was really nice to get to work with them
    more to become more familiar with them. I also enjoyed creating a gif
    with colors, I had never done that before.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 part 1 was a fun assignment to work on because of all the different
    parking signs we had to take into consideration for the project. I enjoyed
    looking at the signs and figuring out what kind of boolean statements
    should be used for each sign. It felt like a puzzle that was fun to 
    solve.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was particularly enjoyable because of the different conversions
    we had to use during the assignment. Math is involved in many areas
    of coding so it was good getting some practice using static_cast. 
    It seems hard at first but once I understood how it worked it became
    much simpler
